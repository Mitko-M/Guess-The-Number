# Guess-The-Number
Windows form app on .NET Framework

Simple guess the number app where you have three trys to guess the number from 1 to 10. You can get another three trys if couldn't guess in three with the button "Try again" and after 9 trys you can see what the number is if you are fed up. Have in mind that after pressing "Try again" the number changes because otherwise the minigame will be too easy.
